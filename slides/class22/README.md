# 432 Spring 2019 Class 22: 2019-04-18

- Professor Love's Slides will be posted above: [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/432_2019_slides22.pdf), and [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/432_2019_slides22.Rmd).
- Each 432 class is audio-recorded, and we post the recordings as `.mp3` files after class, above.

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. [Homework 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework/homework6) due at 2 PM on Monday 2019-04-22. Submit via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - In Questions 1-2, you will need to build and describe a visualization using real data. Two good potential sources of data for this work are [FiveThirtyEight's data repository](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/), and the [Tidy Tuesday repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Health Policy Institute of Ohio has [just released its 2019 Health Value Dashboard](https://www.healthpolicyohio.org/2019-health-value-dashboard/), which has some available data that *might* be appropriate.
2. [As noted below](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/README.md#assignment-for-next-class), you need to read one of the three articles I have assigned, and answer two questions about it, bringing your answers to class on Tuesday 2019-04-23.
3. Quiz 2 will be made available to you by 5 PM on 2019-04-25. It is due at 2 PM on 2019-05-02.
4. Your project presentation will be on 04-29, 04-30, 05-02, or 05-07. The [schedule is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project2/project2-schedule.md)
5. Your project portfolio is due on 2019-05-07 at 2 PM, regardless of when your presentation is scheduled.

## Today's Discussion

will be centered around replicable research, statistical significance and *p* values. I will conclude today's conversation with a brief walk through this editorial:

- Ronald L. Wasserstein, Allen L. Schirm & Nicole A. Lazar (2019) [Moving to a World Beyond "p < 0.05"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913), *The American Statistician*, 73:sup1, 1-19, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913). The PDF of this article [is also available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/Moving%20to%20a%20World%20Beyond%20p%200%2005.pdf).

### Assignment for Next Class

We will continue this conversation next time. A key source for that discussion is the [series of articles published as a supplement](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1?nav=tocList&) in *The American Statistician* Vol. 73, Issue 1: 2019. I'll be asking you to read one of these articles in anticipation of our class next Tuesday. Specifically, I'd like you to read one of these three pieces from that supplement:

1. John P. A. Ioannidis [What Have We (Not) Learnt from Millions of Scientific Papers with P Values?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1447512)
2. Sherri Rose & Thomas G. McGuire (2019) [Limitations of P-Values and R-squared for Stepwise Regression Building: A Fairness Demonstration in Health Policy Risk Adjustment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518269)
3. Robert J. Calin-Jageman & Geoff Cumming (2019) [The New Statistics for Better Science: Ask How Much, How Uncertain, and What Else Is Known](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518266)

Read your chosen article and respond to these two questions:

1. In a sentence, restate the most important thing you learned from the article you read.
2. In a sentence, tell us how you could use this article to change your behavior, or the behavior of other people you are doing science with.

Bring your responses to class on Tuesday 2019-04-23.

### Other Articles I'll Reference Today and Next Tuesday include...

- Andrew Gelman and John Carlin [Beyond Power Calculations: Assessing Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) Errors](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/Gelman%20and%20Carlin%202014%20Beyond%20Power%20Calculations.pdf)
- Jeffrey Leek and Roger Peng [P-values are just the tip of the iceberg](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/Leek_and_Peng_Nature2015.pdf)
- Jeffrey D Blume, Lucy D'Agostino McGowan, William D. Dupont, Robert A Greevy [Second-generation p values: Improved rigor, reproducibility and transparency in statistical analyses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/slides/class22/Blume_Second_Gen_P_Values_2018.pdf)

### And, finally - I'm in a show April 26 - May 18

The [details are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater). Please don't feel any obligation to attend, but come if you'd like to. Thanks.
