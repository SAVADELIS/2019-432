    - You should be able to do all of the questions in this assignment now.
2. On Tuesday, I sent you an email, [also available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/projects/project2/project2-next-steps.md), which laid out the next steps for your project 2 proposals.
    - Most people need to respond to my comments in the spreadsheet at http://bit.ly/432-2019-project2-proposal-reactions and submit a new document containing 6 key elements to Canvas in the Project 2 Proposal Revision section by **noon on Monday 2019-04-15**. 
    - For those of you who have already submitted your revision to Canvas, I've reviewed it.
    - As of noon today, 17/38 students have an approved Project 2 proposal.
        - Amy Attaway, Wyatt Bensken, Julijana Conic, Wei Dai, Jordan Fiegl, Joseph Hnath, Jin Li, Morgan McGrath, Laurie Ann Moennich, Devlin Moyer, Michael Osterman, Harry Persaud, Sarah Ronis, Shengxuan Wang, Joshua Wu, Jacqui Yarman, Siyi Zhang
    - Let us know at 431-help or in person if you have questions.
3. [Homework 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/homework/homework6) due at 2 PM on Monday 2019-04-22. Submit via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - In Questions 1-2, you will need to build and describe a visualization using real data. Two good potential sources of data for this work are [FiveThirtyEight's data repository](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/), and the [Tidy Tuesday repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Health Policy Institute of Ohio has [just released its 2019 Health Value Dashboard](https://www.healthpolicyohio.org/2019-health-value-dashboard/), which has some available data that *might* be appropriate.
