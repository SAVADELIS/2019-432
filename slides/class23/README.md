### Assignment for Today

I asked you to read one of these three pieces from that supplement:

1. John P. A. Ioannidis [What Have We (Not) Learnt from Millions of Scientific Papers with P Values?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1447512)
2. Sherri Rose & Thomas G. McGuire (2019) [Limitations of P-Values and R-squared for Stepwise Regression Building: A Fairness Demonstration in Health Policy Risk Adjustment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518269)
3. Robert J. Calin-Jageman & Geoff Cumming (2019) [The New Statistics for Better Science: Ask How Much, How Uncertain, and What Else Is Known](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518266)

After you'd read your chosen article, I asked you to respond to these two questions, and bring your responses to class today.

1. In a sentence, restate the most important thing you learned from the article you read.
2. In a sentence, tell us how you could use this article to change your behavior, or the behavior of other people you are doing science with.

We'll discuss your results next.

## And, finally - I'm in a show April 26 - May 18
