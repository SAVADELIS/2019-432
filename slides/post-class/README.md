# 432 Spring 2019 Materials After the Final Class

Here is where I'll be posting information after our final class meeting.

## Class Close-out

1. TA office hours will continue through Wednesday May 1.
2. 431-help will close at 9 AM on Thursday May 7.
3. The 431 and 432 github repositories will remain open and available to you through the month of May, but will close in June.


## What I'm Rehearsing (Performances continue through May 18)

I am appearing as Miles Gloriosus in **A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum** at Aurora Community Theatre, beginning April 26 for ten performances at 8 PM Fridays and Saturdays through May 18, and also 3 PM Sundays May 5 and 12. I believe that *Forum* has a strong case to be considered the funniest musical ever written. Come see me sing, dance, strut, preen, boast, brag and behave foolishly, with an excellent cast, crew and band.

Please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.
