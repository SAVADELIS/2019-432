# Information for Quiz 2

## The Google Form You'll Need to Actually Submit Your Responses

The Google Form will be provided to you here, by 5 PM on 2019-04-25.

- You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the 2 PM deadline on May 2. 
- Be sure to save your work. To save your work, you will have to select your name below, and also answer the final question - the attestation that you did your work alone, and then submit it. The software will then provide you (and automatically email you) with a link to return to the Quiz while retaining your answers so far. 
- All of your responses must be included in the Google Form. 
- The Google Form contains the possible responses for each question, but not the actual questions themselves, which are contained only in the PDF file of the actual questions for the Quiz, described below.

## Getting Help

You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are NOT allowed to discuss the questions on this Quiz with anyone other than the teaching assistants, and Professor Love, via email at `431-help at case dot edu`. 

- We will try to answer all questions in a timely way, but you should not leave things to the last moment. 
- TA office hours continue through May 1 to help you with your projects, but questions related to the Quiz should be submitted via email to `431-help`.

## A Little Advice, and Grading Details

- In general, the more time-consuming questions to complete are gathered toward the front of the Quiz.
- You should try to answer all 36 questions, as there is no difference in score between an incorrect answer and a blank answer.
- Most questions are worth 3 points each. The exceptions are Questions 1, 2, 7 and 8, which are each worth 6 points. So the total possible score is 120 points. 
- Dr. Love expects to award some partial credit on the 6-point questions, but does not anticipate awarding meaningful partial credit on most of the 3-point questions, and those are (almost exclusively) multiple-choice items. 

## Updating the Quiz

Though we've made a substantial effort to address any points of confusion, it is likely that someone taking the Quiz will identify an issue which needs general clarification. Should that happen, Dr. Love will post a correction or clarification here, and will alert you to that posting via email.
